The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.

> 余：男孩给了他两条新鲜的小鲔鱼，现在像秤锤一样吊在那两条入水最深的钓索之上；在别的钓索上，他挂了一只蓝色的大鲹鱼和一条黄梭鱼，这两个饵以前都曾用过，但是都还完好可用，而且有那些上好的沙丁鱼来增加香味和诱惑。

> 张：那孩子给了他两条新鲜的小鲔鱼，又叫大青花鱼，悬在最深处的两根钓丝上，像秤锤一样。另外两根钓丝上他放了一条青色的大(鱼旱)鱼和一条黄色年幼的梭鱼，都是已经用过了的，但是还没有坏，又有极好的沙汀鱼给它们加上香味和吸引力。

Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths.

> 余：每根钓索像支大铅笔那么粗，都绕在一根烘干了的棍子上，如此饵上一有拉动，棍子便会浸水；每根钓索都有两盘四十英寻长的绳圈，可以系上别的备索，所以必要时，可以让一条大鱼拖开三百英寻以上的钓索。现在老人看着船边的三根棍子刺入水中，一面缓缓地划动，使钩索拖直，并且保持各自应有的深度。

> 张：钓丝总有一枝粗大的铅笔那么粗，每一根都系在一根烤干的木棍上，只要那饵被什么东西一拉或一碰，那木棍就往下一坠；每一根钓丝有两卷绳子，长达四十噚，这绳子还可以接上其余的备用而不用的绳子，所以假使必要的话，一条鱼可以拉出三百噚以上的钓丝。现在这人守望着船边那三根木杆是否往下坠，他轻柔地摇着，使钓丝上下都是笔直的，各个在它适当的深度里。

 It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current.

> 余：天色已经透明，眼看太阳就要升上。旭日从海底淡淡地升起，老人看到了别的渔船紧贴着水面，远离海岸，而且散布在湾流四处。

> 张：天很亮了，随时太阳会升起来。太阳淡淡地从海中升起来，老人可以看见别的船，在水面上低低地浮着，离岸很近，散布在潮流上。

Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.

> 余：不久阳光更亮，光芒照在水面，等到全轮升尽，平稳的海面把阳光反射到他的眼里，十分刺眼，他便避开反光，划船前进。他俯视水中，看着直入海水深处的钓索。他的钓索比别人都拖得直，所以在湾流深处的每一层水面，都有一个引饵恰如他理想地等待着每一条大鱼游过。别的渔人却让钓索随波逐流，有时钓索只入水六十英寻，那些渔人却以为已经入水一百英寻了。

> 张：然后阳光明亮些了，水上亮得耀眼；然后，太阳整个地从海里出来了，平坦的海面把日光反射到他眼睛里，使他感到锐利的痛楚，他摇着船，不去向它。他朝下面的水里看，注视着钓丝，钓丝毕直向黑暗的水中穿进去。他把钓丝弄得比谁的都直，所以在那黑暗的水流中，每一个水平上都有一个饵在那里等着，正在它要在那里的地方，等着任何游鱼。别人就让那饵顺着潮水漂流着，有时候渔夫以为它是在一百噚，其实是在六十噚。

But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.

> 余：可是，他想，我的钓索深度最准。只是我已经不再交运罢了。可是谁又能预料呢？也许就是今天。天天都是新日子。有运气当然好。可是我宁可做得准确。这样，运气一来，我就等着了。

> 张：但是我总把它们弄得非常准确，他想。不过我现在运气不行了。但是谁知道呢？也许今天。每天都是新的一天。运气好当然更好了。但是我宁可准确。那么运气来的时候你是有准备的。

The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.

> 余：这时，太阳已经升上来两小时，向东方眺望，也不那么刺眼了。此刻但见三点小船，紧贴水面，而且远在靠岸的那边。他想，早上的阳光刺眼了一辈子。可是我的眼力依然健好。到了傍晚，我正视落日，眼睛也不会发黑。落日的威力较大。可是旭日真伤眼睛。

> 张：现在太阳上去已经有两个钟头了，向东方望去，眼睛不那么痛了。现在看得见的船只有三条，看上去全非常矮，离岸很近。我这一辈子，看了早晨的太阳总是眼睛痛，他想。然而眼睛还是很好。太阳落山的时候我可以毕直向太阳里望进去，不会眼前发黑，其实傍晚的时候光线还强些。但是早晨总是痛。

Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. "He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.

> 余：正在这时，他看见一只军舰鸟，展开黑色的长翼，在前面的天空飞旋。它一回双翼，迅速地向下斜冲，接着又开始飞旋。“它一定抓到什么东西了，”老人高叫，“它不只是看看的。”他向鸟儿飞旋的地方，继续缓缓地划行。他从容不迫，使钓索保持垂直。他只划得比湾流快些；如果他不想利用鸟儿寻鱼，则他平时捕鱼会划得慢些，可是现在他的捕法仍不失精确。

> 张：正在这时候，他看见一只军舰鸟，长长的黑翅膀，在天空中盘旋着，就在他前面。他两翅膀向后掠着，倾斜着翅膀很快地落下去，然后又在空中盘旋。「他得到了一点什么了，」老人自言自语。「他不光是在那里寻找。」他缓缓地稳定地划着，向那鸟盘旋着的那块地方划去。他不慌不忙地，仍旧使他的钓丝上下毕直。但是他划得比潮流的速度稍微快一点，好把钓丝带紧些，他这打鱼的方式也是对的，不过如果不是想利用那只鸟，他用不着这样快。
