He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally **salao**, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.

> 余：他是个独自在湾流中一条小船上钓鱼的老人，至今已去了八十四天，一条鱼也没逮住。头四十天里，有个男孩子跟他在一起。可是，过了四十天还没捉到一条鱼，孩子的父母对他说，老人如今准是十足地"倒了血霉"，这就是说，倒霉到了极点，于是孩子听从了他们的吩咐，上了另外一条船，头一个礼拜就捕到了三条好鱼。

> 张：他是一个老头子，一个人划着一只小船在墨西哥湾大海流打鱼，而他已经有八十四天没有捕到一条鱼了。在最初的四十天里有一个男孩和他在一起。但是四十天没捕到一条鱼，那男孩的父母就告诉他说这老头子确实一定是晦气星──那是一种最最走霉运的人──于是孩子听了父母的吩咐，到另一只船上去打鱼，那只船第一个星期就捕到三条好鱼。

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his **skiff** empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the **gaff** and **harpoon** and the sail that was **furled** around the mast. The sail was **patched** with flour **sacks** and, furled, it looked like the flag of **permanent** **defeat**.

> 余：孩子看见老人每天回来时船总是空的，感到很难受，他总是走下岸去，帮老人拿卷起的钓索，或者鱼钩和鱼叉，还有绕在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋片打了些补丁，收拢后看来象是一面标志着永远失败的旗子。

> 张：孩子看见那老人每天驾着空船回来，心里觉得很难过，他总去帮他拿那一卷卷的钩丝，或是鱼钩和鱼叉，还有那卷在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋打着补钉；卷起来的时候，看上去像永久的失败的旗帜。

The old man was thin and **gaunt** with deep **wrinkles** in the back of his neck. The brown **blotches** of the **benevolent** skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased **scars** from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

> 余：老人瘦削而憔悴，颈背皱纹深刻。从热带海洋的海面上反射出来的强烈阳光，在老人的双颊上，留下了一块块良性皮肤癌棕色的斑点。那种褐色的疮疱便长满了两颊，两手时常用索拉扯大鱼，也留下深折的瘢痕。这些瘢痕却都不新，只像无鱼的沙漠里风蚀留痕一样苍老。这些疤痕没有一处是新的伤口，它们就如同一个了无生机的沙漠所经历过的侵蚀那样久远。

> 张：老人瘦而憔悴，颈后有深的皱纹。面颊上生着棕色的肿起的一块块，那是热带的海上反映的阳光哂出来的一种无害的瘤。顺着脸的两边，全长满了那肿起的一块块。他的手因为拉绳子，拖曳沉重的鱼，有纹路很深的创痕。但是没有一个伤痕是新的，都是古老的，像一个没有鱼的沙漠里被风沙侵蚀的地层一样。

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and **undefeated**.

> 余：除了眼睛，他身上处处都显得苍老。可是他的眼睛跟海水一样颜色，活泼而坚定。
>
> 张：他的一切全是老的，除了他的眼睛，眼睛和海一个颜色，很愉快，没有战败过。

"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."

> 余：男孩和他爬上了小艇拖靠的海岸，对他说：“桑地雅哥，我又可以跟你一同去了。我们赚了点钱。”
>
> 张： 「山蒂埃戈，」那孩子对他说，他们把小船拉到岸上，正从那里爬上去。「我又可以跟你一同去了。我们赚了点钱。」

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

> 余：老人曾教男孩捕鱼，男孩因此爱他。
>
> 张：老人教了这孩子怎样打鱼，孩子爱他。

"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."

> 余：“不行，”老人说，“你跟上了一条好运的船。就跟下去吧。”
>
> 张： 「不，」老人说，「你现在这条船运气好。你跟着他们吧。」

"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."

> 余：“可是别忘了：有一次你一连八十七天没捉到鱼，后来我们连着三个星期，天天都捉到大鱼。”
>
> 张：「但是你记得有一次你八七十天没打到鱼，然后我们接连三个星期，天天捉到大鱼。」

"I remember," the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you **doubted**."

> 余：“我记得，”老人说，“我晓得，你并不是因为不相信我才离开我。”
>
> 张：「我记得，」老人说。「我知道你不是因为疑心我运气坏所以离开了我。」

"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."

> 余：“是爸爸叫我走的。我是小孩，只好听他的话。”
>
> 张：「是爸爸叫我走的。我是一个小孩，我得要听他的话。」

"I know," the old man said. "It is quite normal." "He hasn't much faith." "No," the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?" "Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the **Terrace** and then we'll take the **stuff** home."

> 余：“我晓得，”老人说，“那是应该的。”“他不大有信心。”“自然了，”老人说，“可是我们有信心，对不对？”“对，”男孩说，“我请你去平台上喝杯啤酒，好不好？喝过了，我们再把这些东西拿回去。”
>
> 张：「我知道，」老人说。「这是很正常的。」「他没有多少信心。」「他没有，」老人说，「可是我们有。是不是？」「是的，」孩子说。「我请你到露台酒店吃杯啤酒，行不行，然后我们把东西拿回去。」

"Why not?" the old man said, "Between fishermen."

> 余：“好呀，打鱼的还用客气吗！”老人说。
>
> 张：「有甚么不行呢？」老人说。「大家都是渔夫。」
