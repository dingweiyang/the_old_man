> 余：当天有鱼获的几个渔夫都已经回来了，他们将捕到的马林鱼剖腹处理后，摊平放在两块厚木板上，一头一个人抬着，两人抬着鱼摇摇晃晃地走进鱼屋，等着冷冻车来将他们载往哈瓦那的市场去。而那些捕到鲨鱼的渔夫，也已经把那些鲨鱼送到在小海湾另一边的鲨鱼工厂去了，在那儿鲨鱼被滑轮垂吊起来，然后被取下肝、割掉鳍、剥下皮，肉也被割成条状准备用盐来腌。
> 张：今天收获好的渔人都已经回来了，把他们的马林鱼宰杀了，把鱼平放在两块木板上，一头一个人抬着，蹒跚的走到鱼房里，在那里等着冰车把鱼运到哈凡那的市场去。捉到鲨鱼的人把它们送到那小海湾另一边的鲨鱼厂去，用滑车把它们吊起来，把肝拿掉，鳍割掉，皮剥掉，肉切成一条条预备腌。
