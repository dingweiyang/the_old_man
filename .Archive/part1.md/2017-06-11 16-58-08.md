He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally **salao**, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.
> 余：他是个独自在湾流中一条小船上钓鱼的老人，至今已去了八十四天，一条鱼也没逮住。头四十天里，有个男孩子跟他在一起。可是，过了四十天还没捉到一条鱼，孩子的父母对他说，老人如今准是十足地"倒了血霉"，这就是说，倒霉到了极点，于是孩子听从了他们的吩咐，上了另外一条船，头一个礼拜就捕到了三条好鱼。

> 张：他是一个老头子，一个人划着一只小船在墨西哥湾大海流打鱼，而他已经有八十四天没有捕到一条鱼了。在最初的四十天里有一个男孩和他在一起。但是四十天没捕到一条鱼，那男孩的父母就告诉他说这老头子确实一定是晦气星──那是一种最最走霉运的人──于是孩子听了父母的吩咐，到另一只船上去打鱼，那只船第一个星期就捕到三条好鱼。

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his **skiff** empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the **gaff** and **harpoon** and the sail that was **furled** around the mast. The sail was **patched** with flour **sacks** and, furled, it looked like the flag of **permanent** **defeat**.
> 余：孩子看见老人每天回来时船总是空的，感到很难受，他总是走下岸去，帮老人拿卷起的钓索，或者鱼钩和鱼叉，还有绕在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋片打了些补丁，收拢后看来象是一面标志着永远失败的旗子。
> 孩子看见那老人每天驾着空船回来，心里觉得很难过，他总去帮他拿那一卷卷的钩丝，或是鱼钩和鱼叉，还有那卷在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋打着补钉；卷起来的时候，看上去像永久的失败的旗帜。

The old man was thin and **gaunt** with deep **wrinkles** in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.
> 余：老人瘦削而憔悴，颈背皱纹深刻。从热带海洋的海面上反射出来的强烈阳光，在老人的双颊上，留下了一块块良性皮肤癌棕色的斑点。

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
