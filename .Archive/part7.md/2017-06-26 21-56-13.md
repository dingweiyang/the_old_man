They had eaten with no light on the table and the old an took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
> 余：他们用餐时，桌上没有灯光，老人也在暗中脱裤上床。他把报纸夹在裤子里，卷起来做个枕头。他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。不久他便睡去，梦见少年时去过的非洲，梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸，还有高耸的海岬、褐色的大山。

> 张：他们刚才吃饭，桌上并没有点灯。老人脱掉长袴，在黑暗中上床。他把袴子卷成一卷当作枕头，中间塞着报纸。他把毯子裹在身上，睡在垫在床上钢丝上的旧报纸上面。他很快就睡熟了，他梦见非洲，在他还是个孩子的时候；还有些长长的金色的海滩，和那白色的海滩，白得耀眼，和那崇高的海岬，和棕色的大山。

He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
> 余：如今他夜夜重回那岸旁，在梦中听见波涛拍岸，又看见土人的小舟来去乘潮。他嗅到甲板上柏油和麻绳的气味，还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。平时他每逢嗅到那陆上的微风，便起来穿衣，去唤醒男孩。可是今夜陆上微风的气息来得太早，他在梦中也知道是太早，便继续做梦，梦见群岛的白峰从海底涌起，又梦见加那利群岛各式各样的港湾和近海的泊站。

> 张：他现在天天晚上住在那海岸上，在他的梦里他听见海涛的吼声，看见土人的小船破浪而来。他睡梦中嗅到甲板上焦油和碎绳的气味，他也嗅到非洲的气味，早晨陆地上吹来的风带来的。他通常都是一嗅到陆地上吹来的风就醒了，穿上衣服就去把孩子叫醒。但是今天夜里那陆地上吹来的风来得非常早，他在梦里也知道是太早，就继续做梦，看见群岛的白色尖顶从海中突出来，然后他梦见加那利群岛的各个海口和碇泊所。
