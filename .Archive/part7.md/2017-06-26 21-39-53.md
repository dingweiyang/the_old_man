They had eaten with no light on the table and the old an took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
> 余：他们用餐时，桌上没有灯光，老人也在暗中脱裤上床。他把报纸夹在裤子里，卷起来做个枕头。他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。不久他便睡去，梦见少年时去过的非洲，梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸，还有高耸的海岬、褐色的大山。

> 张：他们刚才吃饭，桌上并没有点灯。老人脱掉长袴，在黑暗中上床。他把袴子卷成一卷当作枕头，中间塞着报纸。他把毯子裹在身上，睡在垫在床上钢丝上的旧报纸上面。他很快就睡熟了，他梦见非洲，在他还是个孩子的时候；还有些长长的金色的海滩，和那白色的海滩，白得耀眼，和那崇高的海岬，和棕色的大山。
