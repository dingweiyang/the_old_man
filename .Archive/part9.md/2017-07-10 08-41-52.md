## part9

In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.
> 余：昏暗中，老人觉得黎明渐近；他边划边听到飞鱼出水时颤动的声音，和它们坚直的翅膀在暗空飞过时发出的长嘶。他非常欢喜飞鱼，因为它们是他在海上的主要友伴。他总为那些鸟儿感到恻然，尤其是那些娇小、灰黑的海燕，它们老是在飞旋，寻找，而多半又找不着什么东西。他想：“鸟儿的日子比我们还要过得苦，自然那些掠食的和结壮的鸟儿是例外。

> 张：在黑暗中，老人可以觉得早晨渐渐来到了，他一面划着船，听见飞鱼离开水面时发出颤抖的声音，它们在黑暗中飞去，它们那僵硬的翅膀嘶嘶响着。他非常喜欢飞鱼，因为它们是在海洋上主要的友伴。他为鸟雀忧愁，尤其是那种纤小黯黑的燕鸥，老是在那里飞着，找着，差不多永远找不到。他想：「鸟的生活比我们苦，除了那些专靠打劫为生的鸟，和那些有力气的大鸟。

Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say had things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. 
> 余：既然海洋是这么残酷，为什么他们要造出像海燕那么娇小而又精致的鸟儿来呢？她本性良善而又非常美丽。可是她有时竟会变得那么残酷，变时又那么急骤；像这样低声悲吟着、一面飞旋一面潜水觅食的小鸟，长得过于娇嫩，是没法应付大海的。”他想起海时，总觉得她是lamar；西班牙人爱她的时候，就是这么称呼她的。有时爱她的人也会说她的坏话，可是语气里却当她是个女人。

> 张：为什么他们把鸟造得这样纤弱灵巧，像这些海燕一样，而海洋何以这样残酷？她是仁慈的，而且非常美丽。但是她可以变得这样残酷，而且说变说变；那些飞鸟落下去觅食，发出小小的悲哀的鸣声，它们是太纤弱了，在海上生活是不适宜的。他脑子里的海永远是「海娘子」，在西班牙文里，人们爱她的时候总是这样称她。有时候爱她的人也说她的坏话，但是他们说话的口气里总好像她是一个女人。

Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. 
> 余：有些年青的渔人，用救生圈做钓索的浮子，又用鲨鱼肝很赚钱时买来的汽艇捕鱼的，提起她时，总说elmar，那就是阳性了。他们说起她时，总当她是一个对手，一个地方，甚至一个仇敌。可是老人想起她时，总想她是女性，会施大恩或吝于施恩；如果她有时竟也撒野作恶，那是因为她忍不住。他想，月亮撩她，就像月亮撩女人一样。

> 张：有些年轻的渔夫──他们用浮标做钓丝的浮子，而且还有小汽艇，那是他们在鲨鱼肝上赚了钱的时候买下来的──他们称她为「海郎」。那是男性的。他们说到她的时候是将她当作一个竞争的对手，或是一个地方，甚至于当作一个仇敌。但是，老人总想着她是女性的，她可以给人很大的恩宠，也可以不给；假使她做出野蛮的恶毒的事情，那是因为她无法控制自己。月亮影响她，就像月亮影响女人一样，他想着。
