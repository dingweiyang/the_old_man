They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.

> 余：他们坐在平台上，许多渔夫就拿老头子寻开心，可是他并不生气。年纪大些的渔夫只是望着他，觉得难过。可是他们不动声色，却斯文地谈论暖流，谈论他们投索的深度、稳定的好天气，和其他的经历。

> 张：他们在露台上坐着，许多渔夫都取笑那老人，他并不生气。另有些年纪大些的渔人向他看看，觉得很难过。但是他们并不一露出来，他们很客气地谈论着那潮流与他们垂钓的深度，还有这一向天气一直这样好，还有他们的见闻。

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
> 余：当天有鱼获的几个渔夫都已经回来了，他们将捕到的马林鱼剖腹处理后，摊平放在两块厚木板上，一头一个人抬着，两人抬着鱼摇摇晃晃地走进鱼屋，等着冷冻车来将他们载往哈瓦那的市场去。而那些捕到鲨鱼的渔夫，也已经把那些鲨鱼送到在小海湾另一边的鲨鱼工厂去了，在那儿鲨鱼被滑轮垂吊起来，然后被取下肝、割掉鳍、剥下皮，肉也被割成条状准备用盐来腌。

> 张：今天收获好的渔人都已经回来了，把他们的马林鱼宰杀了，把鱼平放在两块木板上，一头一个人抬着，蹒跚的走到鱼房里，在那里等着冰车把鱼运到哈凡那的市场去。捉到鲨鱼的人把它们送到那小海湾另一边的鲨鱼厂去，用滑车把它们吊起来，把肝拿掉，鳍割掉，皮剥掉，肉切成一条条预备腌。 

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbor from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odor because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.

"Santiago," the boy said. "Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. "Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?" "No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net." "I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."
「山帝雅哥，」男孩叫着。「喔！」老人应了一声。他手握着酒杯，正沈浸在多年前的往事回忆中。「我可以出去帮你准备明天要用的沙丁鱼吗？」「不，你去玩棒球吧。我还可以自己划船，而且罗吉里奥委会替我撒网的。」「我想要跟你一道去。即使我不能跟你一起捕鱼，至少我可以在旁边帮帮忙。」

"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man." "How old was I when you first took me in a boat?" "Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?" 
「你请我喝啤酒了啊，」老人说，「你已经是一个大人了。」「你第一次你带我上船的时候，我是几岁呢？」「五岁那一次，你差点把命给丢了，当时我钓上了一条鱼，但是因为太早把它拖上来，几乎让这条船解了体，你还记得吗？」

"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."
「我记得那条鱼拍打尾巴，打断了船板，还有你用棍子敲打它的声音，我记得，你把我丢进入船头，那里有一堆潮湿的绳索，我感觉整条船都在摇摆，并且听见你用棍子打那条鱼的声音，简直就像是在砍树似的，而我满身都是甜甜的血腥味。」

"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?" "I remember everything from when we first went together." The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes. "If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat." 
「你真的能够记得这些吗？还是因为我现在告诉你，你才知道的？」「从我们第一次一起出海，每一件事我都记得很清楚。」老人用他那被阳光照晒、充满信心与爱怜的眼睛望着他。「如果你是我的孩子，我一定带着你出去，去赌一赌，看我们是不是能够成功，」他说，「但是，你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，而你现在又在一条幸运的船上。」

"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too." "I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box." "Let me get four fresh ones."
「我去弄点沙丁鱼来好吗？我还知道哪里可以弄到四个鱼饵哩。」「今天我自己还有剩下一些。已经放在盒子里用盐腌起来了。」「还是让我去弄四个新鲜的来吧。」

"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises. "Two," the boy said. "Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?" "I would," the boy said. "But I bought these." 
「一个就够了，」老人说。他的希望和信心从未消失过，而现在，一股崭新的希望和信心又如微风冉冉升起了。「两个，」男孩说。「两个就两个吧！」老人同意了，「你该不会是去偷的吧？」「我可能会噢！」男孩说：「不过这两个我是用买的。」

"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride. "Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said. "Where are you going?" the boy asked.
