They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.

> 余：他们坐在平台上，许多渔夫就拿老头子寻开心，可是他并不生气。年纪大些的渔夫只是望着他，觉得难过。可是他们不动声色，却斯文地谈论暖流，谈论他们投索的深度、稳定的好天气，和其他的经历。

> 张：他们在露台上坐着，许多渔夫都取笑那老人，他并不生气。另有些年纪大些的渔人向他看看，觉得很难过。但是他们并不一露出来，他们很客气地谈论着那潮流与他们垂钓的深度，还有这一向天气一直这样好，还有他们的见闻。

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
> 余：这一天，满载的渔人已经归来，正剖好马林鱼，横放在两条木板子上，每条板端由两个渔人蹒跚地抬着，走向鱼库，再等冰车载去哈瓦那的市场。有的捕到鲨鱼，就运到对湾的鲨鱼厂去，把它挂上了滑车的钓钩，去了肝，割了鳍，刮了皮，最后把鱼肉切成一条条的，用盐腌起。

> 张：今天收获好的渔人都已经回来了，把他们的马林鱼宰杀了，把鱼平放在两块木板上，一头一个人抬着，蹒跚的走到鱼房里，在那里等着冰车把鱼运到哈凡那的市场去。捉到鲨鱼的人把它们送到那小海湾另一边的鲨鱼厂去，用滑车把它们吊起来，把肝拿掉，鳍割掉，皮剥掉，肉切成一条条预备腌。 

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbor from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odor because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace. 
> 余：每有东风，对湾的鲨鱼厂就会飘来一股腥气；可是今天只有一丝淡淡的气味，因为风向已由东转北，又渐渐平息，平台上阳光晴好。

"Santiago," the boy said. "Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. "Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?" "No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net." "I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."
> 余：“桑地雅哥。”男孩唤他。“嗯。”老人应道。他正端着杯子，追想往日。“我去弄点沙丁鱼给你明天用，好不好？”“算了。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗吉略可以撒网。”“我真想去。就是不能跟你去打鱼，我也要帮你点什么忙。”

"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man." "How old was I when you first took me in a boat?" "Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?" 
> 余：“你请我喝了啤酒，”老人说，“你已经是个大人了。”“你第一次带我上船，我有多大了？”“五岁。你差点送了命，当时我太早把鱼拉了上来，它几乎把船撞碎。你还记得吗？”

"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."
> 余：“我还记得它的尾巴拍来拍去的响声，坐板给打碎，你用棍子打得砰砰响。我还记得你把我丢进放着湿绳圈的船头，我觉得全船都在震动，你用棍子打它的声音就像砍倒了一棵树，四周都是甜腻腻的血腥气味。”

"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?" "I remember everything from when we first went together." The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes. "If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat." 
> 余：“你真的记得，还是全听我告诉你的？”“从我们第一回一同出海起，我什么都记得。”老人用他长晒阳光的、信任而爱怜的眼睛注视着他。“要你是我的孩子，我就带你出海去冒险，”他说，“可是你是你爸爸妈妈的乖孩子，又跟上了一条好运的船。”

"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too." "I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box." "Let me get four fresh ones.""One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises. "Two," the boy said. "Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?" "I would," the boy said. "But I bought these." 
> 余：“我去弄沙丁鱼好吗？我还晓得去哪儿找四个饵。”“今天的我自己留下了。我把它们腌在盒子里。”“我去弄四条新鲜的。”“一条好了。”老人说。他的希望和信心从不消失，如今正像微风渐起那么重新旺盛起来。“两条吧。”男孩说。“就两条，”老人同意了，“你不是偷来的吧？”“我倒想偷，”男孩说，“可是我买了。”

"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride. "Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said. "Where are you going?" the boy asked.
> 余：“谢谢你。”老人说。他心地单纯，还不会自问何时变得如此谦虚。可是他自知已变谦虚，觉得如此并不可耻，也无损真正的自尊。“湾流不变的话，明天准是个好晴天。”他说。“你去哪儿？”男孩问他。
