"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."
> 余：“你要喝咖啡吗？”男孩问道。“我们先把这些东西放在船上，再去喝。”他们到专做渔人生意的早食店里，用炼乳罐头盛咖啡喝。“你睡得好吗，老头子？”男孩问道。虽然打断睡眠，仍感不适，他现在总算渐渐地醒过来了。“好极了，曼诺林，”老人说，“我今天觉得很有把握。”“我也是的，”男孩说，“现在我得去拿你和我的沙丁鱼，还有你的新饵。他总是自己拿我们的东西。他从来不要别人拿。”

> 张：「你要喝咖啡么？」孩子问。「我们把工具放在船上，再去喝咖啡。」他们到一个大清早做渔夫们生意的地方，用听头炼乳的洋铁罐喝咖啡。「老头子你睡得怎么样？」孩子问。他现在渐渐醒过来了，但是他仍旧很难摆脱睡意。「我睡得很好，玛诺林，」老人说。「今天我很有信心。」「我也有，」孩子说。「现在我得去拿你同我的沙汀鱼，还有你的新鲜的饵。我们的工具他自己带来。他从来不要别人帮着拿什么。」

"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.
> 余：“我们可就不同，”老人说，“你才五岁，我就让你拿东西了。”“我记得，”男孩说，“我马上就回来。再喝一杯咖啡吧。我们可以记账。”他赤脚踩着珊瑚岩，向藏饵的冰屋走去。老人缓缓地饮着咖啡。一天就吃这些了，他知道非吃不行。近来他久已不甘饮食，也从来不带午餐。他在船头藏水一瓶，一整天就够了。

> 张：「我们是两样的，」老人说。「你才五岁的时候，我就让你拿着东西。」「我知道，」孩子说。「我马上就回来。再喝杯咖啡。我们在这里可以赊赈的。」他走开了，赤着脚踏在珊瑚石上，走到冰房里去，饵贮藏在那里。老人慢慢地喝他的咖啡。他一天就吃这么点东西，他知道他应当吃掉它。他久已对吃喝感到厌倦了，现在他出去从来不带午饭。他有一瓶水放在船头上，除此以外他这一整天什么都不需要了。
